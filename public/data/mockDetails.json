To date, the Foundation has reportedly contributed 16M of EMC2 coins for science projects.\r\n\r\nEMC2 is a Scrypt coin that uses the Kimoto gravity well with a 50% block reduction and a 60 second block time to democratize the mining process.

This shield entails \"identified mining\".

Self-funded by a community of volunteers, NavCoin launched in April 2014 with no Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or pre-mine. Volunteers can propose contributions and get paid for work through NavCoin’s decentralised Community Fund (CF). \r\n\r\nWith the CF’s dual consensus mechanism, the funding of a passed proposal will be locked while waiting for its work to be completed and then paid out if the quorum is met. Examples of CF proposals include www.navexplorer.com, the NEXT wallet, the implementation of ZeroCT (a privacy protocol), and the time when NAV became a carbon-neutral cryptocurrency. NavCoin has also added support for OpenAlias (www.openalias.org), Cold Staking to the NavCoin protocol, and released NavPay, a light wallet to store and spend NAV from a mobile device.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about NavCoin, please visit www.navcoin.org.",

Over the years more advancements were added to the protocol, with each major upgrade rebranding the name of the protocol (first \"DarkNote\" and then ultimately \"DigitalNote\").  Much like Bitcoin's \"Satoshi Nakamoto\", the original founder(s) vanished in 2017, leaving the open source code to be updated by a community team who have since continued development.",

However, unlike Ripple, Stellar.org is non-profit and their platform itself is open source and decentralized. Through the use of its intermediary currency Lumens (XLM), a user can send any currency that they own to anyone else in a different currency. \r\n\r\nStellar was founded by Jed McCaleb in 2014. Jed McCaleb is also the founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the network system Stellar with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Stellar is also a payment technology that aims to connect financial institutions and drastically reduce the cost and time required for cross-border transfers.

Verge uses the anonymity tool Tor and an anonymous network layer I2P to hide specific transactions’ IP addresses and locations. Transaction speed on Verge is estimated to be at 5 seconds due to the use of Simple Payment Verification (SPV). The Core QT wallet has built-in TOR integration and SSL encryption which obfuscates the IP addresses of users. The introduction of the Wraith Protocol upgrade enables users to send and receive payments privately across the Verge blockchain by enabling stealth addressing services. Verge users are reportedly able to switch between private and public ledgers on the Verge blockchain. Verge offers five different Proof-of-Work algorithms for mining - Lyra2rev2, Scrypt, X17, blake2s and myr-groestl.",

After a SHA256 proof-of-work phase, Bean Cash became a pure PoS currency; the block reward is fixed at 1000 Beans plus any transaction fees attached to the transactions included.  This was the first instance of this version of PoS, which the Bean Cash community calls \"Proof of Bean\" (PoB).  Bean Cash' target block time is one minute, with a maximum block size of 20MB.  It is projected to reach its maximum supply of 50 billion beans in 2111.\r\n\r\nThe team consists of volunteers from around the world who donate time and resources to the project.  Team Bean is the greater Bean Cash community, consisting of anyone who has an interest in the technology.  Anyone who can prove they hold 1% or more of the current outstanding Bean Cash may join Bean Core and have a vote in the direction Bean Cash development takes.  The Executive Board consists of 3 Bean Core members who hold 5% or more of the current outstanding Bean Cash.  They rule by consensus.  If a vote is not unanimous, it does not pass.  The Board may overrule suggestions coming from Bean Core or put forward its own suggestions.  The Board can, likewise, be overruled by a 2/3 super-majority of Bean Core.",

To wit, it allows for the public verification of an asset’s existence through its chain of custody via its Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol, which makes use of the Ethereum network and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Digix also offers an API that enables other applications to be built on top of its asset tokenization service. Digix has 2 cryptocurrencies, Digix Gold (DGX) and DigixDAO (DGD). The company reportedly procures its gold from LBMA-approved refiners. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. The DGD crowdsale in Mar 2016 was the first crowdsale and major DAO hosted on the Ethereum network.",

Founded in 2016 by Ned Scott and BitShares creator Dan Larimer, the Steemit platform, built atop the Steem blockchain, is a social media network that seeks to be a source of community-driven curated content such as news, Q&A and job boards. The more value a particular piece of content is able to deliver across a greater number of people, the greater the reward received by the creator. Steemit users can cast votes to create a hierarchy of content. The higher the upvote count received on a content piece, the more Steem is earned by its publisher. Steemit’s meritocratic system also enables users that hold more currency to cast more meaningful, greater influence votes. ",

In 2017, Waves launched its mainnet with LPoS, decentralized exchange DEX, and later the Waves-NG protocol. In 2018, the Waves development team delivered the first implementation of smart contracts. This was followed by the release of the RIDE programming language in 2019, Strightforward, Predictible and Failproof language for programming logic. In June 2019 the mainnet of Waves Enterprise, a global private blockchain solution, was launched. All of this is complemented with a broad infrastructure: an IDE for sandbox development, tools, SDKs, libraries, frameworks, and protocols for convenient and easy integrations.\r\n\r\nWaves Platform consists of three core layers:\r\n\r\nProtocol layer: LPoS, Waves-NG, fixed fees, easy mining start, various transactions models\r\n\r\nInfrastructure layer: Keeper for private key management, IDE for sandbox development, smart-contracts programming language RIDE and other tools for dApp development, API’s, libraries, tools, and frameworks.\r\n\r\nApplication layer: basic core open-source apps (decentralized exchange, mobile apps, and voting) and various dApps running on the network.",

With Zcoin’s Sigma feature, only the sender and receiver would be able to ascertain the exchange of funds in a given transaction, as no transaction histories are linked to the actual coins. Zcoin is also the creator of the Lelantus privacy protocol which improves Sigma's privacy and functionality.",

            "description": "Launched in 2015, Nano describes itself as an open source, sustainable, and secure next-generation digital currency focused on removing perceived inefficiencies present in existing cryptocurrencies. Designed to solve peer to peer transfer of value, Nano aims to revolutionize the world economy through an ultrafast and fee-less network that is open and accessible to everyone. \r\n\r\nNano is reportedly able to offer fast and feeless transactions due to the Block Lattice - a data structure in which all accounts each have their own blockchain, rather than competing with others on a central chain. Consensus is generated through representative voting, where accounts can freely choose their representative at any time with an update of their account chain, thereby providing more control for users to decide who validates transactions.\r\n\r\nEach component of the protocol was created with the long term goals of decentralization and accessibility in mind. By creating a system where representatives are not paid to operate, the incentive to participate in the network is shifted to indirect, operational cost savings. The team claims that this change in incentive model is more efficient and removes one of the factors driving centralization in other systems because participants are not encouraged to interact beyond their direct needs and supporting the network, and thus economies of scale become less critical.",

Written in Golang and running on the Obelisk consensus algorithm, Skycoin is focused on security, usability, and ease of use. Obelisk is predicated on the notion of ‘web of trust dynamics’, which makes consensus decisions depending upon the influence score of each node. Each node subscribes to a select number of other network nodes, and the density of a node’s network of subscribers determines its influence on the network.\r\n\r\nSkywire, the flagship application of Skycoin, aims to decentralize the internet at the hardware level.

Blockchain technology is used to organize a market network where users can monetize their computing power, applications, and datasets. By providing on-demand access to cloud computing resources, iExec is reportedly able to support compute-intensive applications in fields such as AI, big data, healthcare, rendering, or FinTech.\r\n\r\nThe iExec network is made up of computing resource providers. Computing power providers are called ‘iExec Workers’. As workers, users can connect their machines and be rewarded in RLC tokens for contributing resources to the network. Application providers can monetize their applications and algorithms. Data providers who own valuable datasets can make them available for use by applications through iExec. The iExec consensus protocol ‘PoCo’ (Proof of Contribution) provides consensus over off-chain computing and can also be used to integrate decentralized oracles with iExec.\r\n\t\r\niExec believes that its strength lies in trusted off-chain computing.

Fortuna Stakes reportedly receive 33% of each POW & POS block that is mined.  FS/MN Collateral is 5000 D.\r\n\r\nTribus (Latin for three) is the Proof of Work hashing algorithm used in Denarius.

According to technical documents, the platform connects invoice sellers directly to buyers granting expedited access to funds for the sellers offering their invoices at a discount to buyers. Appropriate discounts may be applied based on mathematical ratios that assess risk factors such as profitability, leverage, solvency and activity as variables that could predict the likelihood of bankruptcy. In this arrangement, invoice buyers intending to take advantage of these discounts by transacting using the native Ethereum-based PPT tokens on the platform would receive the amount previously agreed upon once invoices are paid by the debtor.",

The project's mission is to empower individuals through ownership of their personal data using decentralized technologies.\r\n\r\nThe Pillar Wallet is intended to be an intuitive and social cryptocurrency management tool. It aims to allow users to build a contact book -- rather than searching for blockchain addresses -- so that sending assets is as easy as sending a message. It stores users' entire transaction history, provides real-time notifications on all activity, offers 24/7 in-app support, and an end-to-end encrypted chat function. The next step is smart contract based, recoverable accounts, integrated with exchanges and token swap platforms. It aims to provide free, instant and private transactions via off-chain payment channels.\r\n\r\nAs a native token, PLR powers the platform and is used for payments, services, providing access to the Pillar Payment network, and serves as a usage fee benchmark. Pillar users will be able to operate the wallet platform, manage assets and identity, transact with other users, access enhanced functionality, open payment channels, exchange supported synthetic assets, and cover network fees using only the PLR token.",

            "description": "Chainlink (LINK) is a decentralized oracle service, which aims to connect smart contracts with data from the real world. Since blockchains cannot access data outside their network, oracles are needed to function as data feeds in smart contracts. Oracles provide external data (e.g. temperature, weather) that trigger smart contract executions upon the fulfillment of pre-defined conditions. Participants on the Chainlink network are incentivized (through rewards) to provide smart contracts with access to external data feeds. Should users desire access to off-chain data, they can submit a requesting contract to ChainLink’s network. These contracts will match the requesting contract with the appropriate oracles. The contracts include a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The aggregating contract gathers data of the selected oracles to find the most accurate result.",

Kin coins enter circulation via an incentive model referred to as the Kin Rewards Engine, or \"KRE\", which rewards the developers that create compelling user experiences with Kin based on their engagement. This offers a software monetization model that incentivizes the adoption of new use cases and creation of value for a cryptocurrency, as well as encouraging the exchange of value between users, as opposed to harvesting user data and attention at no benefit to users themselves. This new alternative re-aligns users and developers around a shared digital economy in which the content creators and developers that generate value are the focus, not big-data monopolies.\r\n\r\nThe Kin blockchain operates autonomously via a federated consensus model, currently comprised of 11+ globally distributed validator nodes, in order to maintain fault tolerance while also allowing for little-to-no fees and fast confirmation speeds. The identities of the node operators are currently private in order to maintain operational security, but these are reportedly independent, reputable digital service providers, with a history of reliable availability and maintenance. \r\n\r\nThe distribution and algorithmic logic of the Kin Rewards Engine is overseen by the Kin Foundation, a non-profit organization based out of Ontario, Canada. Undistributed Kin is held in an institutional-grade treasury that is controlled via a series of vesting periods, inflation guidelines, and fiduciary custody controls that ensure the safe transfer and proper use of funds. Anti-spam and anti-fraud assurances are also provided as a service until such time that the distribution of Kin can be fully automated with those additional safeguards in place. No more than 10 trillion Kin will ever exist by the end of the distribution period, the large supply meant to allow mass adoption by users around the world while still transacting in whole-number denominations, as opposed to decimal places.",

It aims to combine a self-correcting protocol and on-chain governance to manage network modifications. Tezos is powered by XTZ, which is created through 'baking'. Bakers put up deposits and are rewarded for signing and publishing blocks. Witnesses then validate the blocks. Dishonest bakers lose their XTZ deposits. Tezos uses delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) and supports Turing complete smart contracts. Tezos is implemented in the OCaml programming language, which is said to offer 'functional, imperative, and object-oriented styles'.",

With ICON’s “blockchain transmission protocol”, independent blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum can connect and transact with each other. This opens up cross-chain use cases that are impossible without an interoperability layer like ICON.\r\n\r\nICON Network describes itself as a general-purpose blockchain protocol based on the native cryptocurrency ICX that can run smart contracts, adopt the BFT-DPoS (Delegated Proof-of-Stake) consensus protocol, and use an economic-governance protocol called DPoC (Delegated Proof-of-Contribution). The ICON Network is powered by a proprietary blockchain engine called 'loopchain' and has the ability to handle hundreds of transactions per second. The ICON project was started to ensure the integrity and transparency of data shared between institutions and companies, and to move mutual assets on heterogeneous blockchains without a centralized organization. In the long term, ICON Network aims to become an 'interchain' that connects multiple blockchains based on BTP technology.\r\n\r\nThe ICON blockchain is powered by loopchain, a blockchain engine designed by ICONLOOP. ICONLOOP is responsible for loopchain’s government and enterprise adoption in South Korea. Loopchain is the Seoul Metropolitan Government’s standard blockchain platform.",

            "description": "Founded in early 2017, Upfiring was established to create an alternative to traditional P2P file-sharing protocols by incentivizing seeders through the use of a tokenized file-sharing economy. Traditional P2P file-sharing and networks offer no incentives for seeders and as a result, low file availability and slow downloading speeds are frequent issues. By incentivizing seeding, Upfiring aims to create a healthier file-sharing network that allows content creators and seeders to be rewarded directly for sharing content without any third-party intermediaries. \r\n\r\nUpfiring’s first usable dapp prototype launched on mainnet in December 2018, with their full application launching on 5 February 2019. The dapp is cross-platform - available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The application allows users to generate encrypted .ufr files with embedded price data and seed them on the Upfiring network. Users earn UFR tokens in exchange for seeding and keeping files online. Seeder smart contracts deployed to the Ethereum network mediate the movement of files across the network, maintain seeder UFR balances and allow for the decryption of files when warranted.\r\n\r\nUpfiring targets content-creators by allowing them to promote their content directly to users without relying on any third-party intermediaries. UFR tokens are used within the dapp to unlock encrypted content. The dapp can be downloaded from https://www.upfiring.com, and the corresponding documentation can be found at [https://www.upfiring.com/documentation.html](https://www.upfiring.com/documentation.html)",

            "description": "AppCoins is an open and distributed protocol for app stores based on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. It redesigns app advertising, in-app purchases (IAP), and app approval flows through a circular model. As a higher share of the advertising and IAP revenue is kept within the app ecosystem, more value is retained in the app economy. Being an open protocol, it would theoretically provide more transparency and trust. Multiple app stores can implement and benefit from this and stakeholders will have to contribute to its development and adoption. Furthermore, API integration will streamline implementation.\r\n\r\nAppCoins integrates app stores, users, developers, advertisers, and OEMs. This system is app store agnostic, existing across different mobile platforms (Android & iOS). The different app stores act as oracles of the smart contracts, which are associated with each of the platform’s core transactions. This system creates a trust layer for the economy, obviating the need for intermediaries. AppCoins aims to become the universal language of the app economy.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also includes a so-called Proof-of-Attention system. Users, app stores, and OEMs receive tokens through the Proof-of Attention concept as a reward. Developers that want to advertise their apps can be sure that the user has installed and used it. The users reinvest their tokens via inapp purchases and this would theoretically create a virtuous loop that boosts the AppCoins economic growth.\r\n\r\n- Link to the Source Code: https://github.com/AppStoreFoundation  \r\n- Chat: https://t.me/appcoinsofficial  \r\n- Announcement: https://medium.com/@appcoins \r\n- Source: Official website: https://appcoins.io",

Sharding is analogous to the concept of 'divide and conquer', where transactions are divided into smaller groups for miners to perform parallel transactional verification. The upshot of this is the ability to reach consensus more quickly, which would increase the number of transactions in a given period. According to the white paper, transactions speed could scale to approximately 1000x that of Ethereum's network. Zilliqa’s high throughput means that developers can focus on fleshing out their ideas rather than worrying about network congestion. ",

It is purportedly able to support 50K transactions per second and uses a Hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism. The consensus mechanism makes use of value-added computation through the use of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. MATRIX Intelligent Contracts use Natural Language Programming and adaptive deep learning-based templates to auto-code. MAN tokens are mined and used to power real-world applications. The project has reportedly collaborated with Beijing cancer Research hospital to improve speed and accuracy of a cancer diagnosis.",

Established in Jan 2018, the CargoX dApp uses Ethereum for transferring digital original documents. Initially focused on the global freight and supply chain documents, the company, in 2019, began expanding its BDTS (blockchain document transaction system) solution to verticals like air cargo, with a view towards providing a universal solution for document ownership transfer that is reportedly fast, safe, reliable and cost-effective. BDTS's smart contracts provide audit logs of all sent documents and can prove that the documents were genuine and not tampered with during the transfer.",

            "description": "Nectar was originally launched in 2017 by the Bitfinex spin-off exchange, Ethfinex — a team based out of London, UK — with the purpose of rewarding market makers for the value they create whilst simultaneously serving as the primary voting mechanism, allowing traders to govern the exchange and decide, among other things, which tokens they wish to see listed next. The project was designed to experiment with and develop novel governance processes with the aim of solving pain points seen with centralized exchanges including opaque and costly token listing procedures.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn August 2019, Ethfinex evolved into DeversiFi, bringing with it an overhaul of the Nectar token. Nectar now serves as the native utility and governance token of decentralised exchange DeversiFi. NEC 2.0 features a buy & burn mechanism, DeversiFi trading fee-discounts, and promotes participation from the wider Blockchain ecosystem through the NecDAO — launching in December 2019 with a reported ~ 17,500ETH constituted for the community-driven allocation of funds and governance of both DeversiFi and Nectar.community.",
            "notice": "Please be aware that Nectar tokens were initially distributed via the Ethfinex exchange and the majority of tokens are still held on the exchange, only those tokens which have been withdrawn and are transferable on the Ethereum blockchain are included in the circulating supply calculation.",

            "description": "Holochain (HOT) is a decentralized application platform that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent-centric agreement and consensus mechanisms between users. In Holochain, no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private fork that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed hash table. This enables every device on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary, or agreed upon by users. This could translate into higher scalability for dapps hosted on Holochain. The Holo ecosystem relies on hosts that provide processing and storage for distributed applications while earning redeemable credits. Holochain Dapps can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp, with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.",

The project provides the infrastructure to create tokens backed by physical assets on the blockchain. To wit, it allows for the public verification of an asset’s existence through its chain of custody via its Proof of Provenance (PoP) protocol, which makes use of the Ethereum network and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). \r\n\r\nDigix also offers an API that enables other applications to be built on top of its asset tokenization service. \r\n\r\nDigix has 2 cryptocurrencies, Digix Gold (DGX) and DigixDAO (DGD). \r\n\r\nThe company reportedly procures its gold from LBMA-approved refiners. For security, Digix includes third-party auditing from Bureau Veritas. The DGD crowdsale in Mar 2016 was the first crowdsale and major DAO hosted on the Ethereum network.",

The PCHAIN mainnet was launched on 30 Mar 2019. \r\n\r\nPCHAIN was founded by a team that has reportedly published 100 IEEE ACM papers and international patents. PCHAIN claims to have been granted 6 patents. As of 1 Apr 2019, the PCHAIN team is based in Singapore, Shanghai, State of Qatar & Silicon Valley. It has 70K+ followers in Bihu (a Chinese social platform ) and 60K+ followers in Telegram from nearly one hundred countries.\r\n\r\nPCHAIN has reportedly received strategic investments from global funds such as FBG, Plug&Play, LD Capital, JRR, Genesis, Bixin and LinkVC,etc. PCHAIN also received the Silicon Valley’s“Most Promising Blockchain Foundation Platform 2018”award and was hailed as the“Best Blockchain Platform in 2018” by Bitcoinist. PCHAIN has board collaboration with over 30 blockchain partners such as North America Blockchain Association, IEEE, CFLP, etc.\r\n\r\nKey features include:\r\n\r\n- Native EVM multichain that enables the interoperability of child chain and main chain. It can reportedly support 256+ child chains in testnet 1.0 with 1064 nodes globally. The project claims that the network supports 126K TPS and can be scaled linearly as the number of child chains increases.\r\n- Patented PDBFT algorithm that combines VRF+BLS+BFT is reportedly able to support more nodes than traditional PBFT algorithms.\r\n- Oracle mechanism based on the knowledge graph reportedly makes it easier to encapsulate smart contracts - W3C compliant smart data addresses the issue of non-intelligence in smart contracts\r\n- Safe Delegation and Blind Bidding that reportedly enables a fair and secure validator election during epoch switches.\r\n- Cross-chain capability. The smart contracts of PCHAIN can purportedly be invoked with other non-native tokens (BCH, ERC20) by using the provided toolkit.",

            "description": "Launched on 19 Jan 2019, Etherzero was created through a hardfork at Block 4936270. The new blockchain, based on the PoW consensus, was launched with 194,000,000 ETZ premined coins. 97,000,00 ETZ were issued 1:1 to all holders of ETH as an Airdrop. The remaining 97.000.000 ETZ are owned by the team and serve to ensure further development.\r\n\r\nIn June 2018, the team decided to switch from PoW to PoS for security reasons. They decided on a new construction: MPoS, masternode proof-of-Stake. The MPoS consensus aims to combine the energy-saving process of Staking with the security and decentralization of masternodes in conjunction with autonomous self-government by the community. \r\n\r\nThe new network was launched in August 2018. It features 1-2 second block times and the Power and Slow-Nodes-Judge security management. Etherzero is reportedly fully compatible with Ethereum, allowing developers to publish their smart contracts on the Etherzero Blockchain free of charge.",

The first 'chainhop' took place in summer 2019, between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Metronome reportedly offers advanced payment features as programmable money.\r\n\r\n- Mass pay: The ability to send MET to multiple addresses in a single transaction to save on transaction fees. \r\n- Subscriptions: The ability to authorize a set amount of MET to move between two addresses on a recurring basis.",

The dApp is called 0Box and it is a Dropbox-style, trustless private cloud which does not require any logins or emails. User data is backed up with the assurance of privacy, transparency, and anonymity.\r\n\r\nZCN is a cryptoasset tied to data and is used for storage. The value of ZCN is based on data stored on the network. Token holders receive \"free\" services (storage, transactions) by locking ZCN. 0Wallet reportedly protects ZCN assets with serverless 2FA using mobile and laptop.  User assets will reportedly remain safe even if either device gets compromised,",

Vite uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm. To reduce the security risks associated with DAG, Vite incorporates its Snapshot Chain technology.  \r\n\r\nThe core of Vite's platform features asynchronous architecture, which reportedly allows for the (i)  separate writing of requests and responses, (ii) transaction writing and confirmation, and (iii) communication between contracts. For dApp development, Vite utilizes the Solidity++ smart contract language.\r\n\r\nVite aims to provide a complete ecosystem of products to accommodate everyday users, traders, and developers. Currently, its product suite includes a wallet, DEX (currently in beta), and a payment network. Vite is working on a comprehensive set of SDKs that will allow developers to easily build dApps on its platform.",

The MEET.ONE team aims to empower traditional internet companies by helping them to integrate their business with the blockchain so that users will be able to monetize and exchange the value that they create easily, securely, and freely. \r\n\r\nIn 2019, the team plans to incubate 1-2 projects (with millions of users) that intend to move their businesses onto the MEET.ONE chain. In Q2-2020, the goal is to have over 10M on-chain accounts. The MEET.ONE wallet supports different public blockchains such as EOS and Binance, MEET.ONE, and Cosmos. Additionally, the plan is to allow users to manage, trade, and stake their assets, as well as access dApps and blockchain news. MEET.ONE wallet aims to become a portal for new users to experience the MEET.ONE blockchain. \r\n\r\nThe MEET.ONE team reportedly raised several million dollars in a private sale in 2018 to cover operating expenses for the subsequent 3 years. They were reportedly able to breakeven in November of 2018. The team's self-reported circulating supply is approximately 5B, of which 1B has been locked up on the MEET.ONE chain and re-deployed on the Binance chain.",

It aims to tackle the problems of current blockchain technologies, especially limited transaction capacity and lack of use cases due to user-unfriendliness. TTC has reportedly implemented an optimized consensus mechanism called Multi-tier BFT-DPoS to ensure high transaction speed and Master/Slave network combination to provide near limitless scalability. \r\n\r\nTTC serves as the universal currency in the TTC ecosystem for four major utilities. First, TTC is rewarded to Representatives and Voters for consensus mining. Second, it is used to pay for the deployment of smart contracts. Third, TTC can be paid as Gas fees for asset transactions and usage of Slave networks. Lastly, it can be used to purchase services and products which integrates the TTC main network.",

The company is focused on bringing cryptocurrency to ordinary users by making it more user-friendly and reducing user error.  \r\n\r\nThe Divi team launched its blockchain on 27 September 2018. The team is reportedly known for inventing the multi-tier masternode concept, and claims to be the only masternode that can be set up from the wallet with a single click using its \"MOCCI\" system.  Divi also has weekly lottery blocks that pay 11 of its stakers. Divi aims to create its own user-friendly \"Chain Lightning\" network that they believe will be more usable than Bitcoin's version.  It will have atomic swaps, an advanced governance system, and a multi-coin wallet that is designed to make Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies user-friendly too. \r\n\r\nThe Divi Project won third place in the 2018 \"Token Tank\" contest at World Crypto Con in Las Vegas, and also was rated the #3 best Masternode, behind only Dash and PIVX, by Omni Analytics. The Divi team includes four different advisers who speak frequently on the national circuit.  This includes former Yahoo Chief Solutions Officer Tim Sanders, futurist Ramez Naam, former Coin Telegraph CEO Toni Lane Casserly, Doug Scott, former President of Ogilvy Entertainment, and top crypto influencers Joel Comm and Travis Wright from the Bad Crypto Podcast. The Divi team has been interviewed on national television multiple times, including on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, at NASDAQ, and on Tech Republic.",

MetaApps constitute a platform for building stand-alone decentralized applications that may be written in several languages such as C++, PHP, and Solidity. MetaGate, a user interface with an open source for third-party developers. Finally, MHC is a digital asset that acts as a means of payment in the network and is meant to provide consensus along with the regulation of the financing for network development.",

            "description": "Lunes describes itself as a Brazilian technology company that creates B2B and B2C blockchain solutions. Its services and products aim to democratize finance by offering fundraising, payment methods, and commercial automation using cryptocurrencies\r\n\r\nLunes claims to be the largest cryptocurrency in Latin America. It was developed with the goal of offering total transparency and fast/cheap transactions. Lunes' blockchain is prepared to store and guarantee the security of any kind of information, viz. document authenticity records, digital asset issuance, and execution of smart contracts.\r\n\r\nOn the Lunes' blockchain, the generation time of the key block occurs every 60 seconds; the micro-blocks take a few seconds. It reportedly has the maximum capacity of 65,500 transactions per minute and 1,092 per second. The validation of transactions on the Lunes network occurs through the LPoS (Leased Proof-of-Stake), which the Lunes team believes to be the safest validation scheme for blockchain.\r\n\r\nIn Leased Proof-of-Stake any network participant - who owns more than 5000 Lunes - can become a validator node, contributing to the security and gaining a share of network transaction fees as a reward. In addition, with the leasing system, anyone can join the network as a validator.\r\n\r\nTools already launched in the market:\r\n- Wallet - (https://luneswallet.app/)\r\n- Digital signature - (https://lunestruth.com.br/en/)",

Users scan a QR code at the point of sale, and the Flexa Network Protocol (FNP) trades the crypto spent for fiat which is then returned to the merchant. \r\n\r\nFlexa returns a percentage of every processed transaction to users. Flexa’s FNP uses the ERC 20-compliant token called Flexacoin for transactions and a variety of members-only network incentives. The name “Flexa” is an abbreviation of flexibility, according to the team. Flexa requires no additional hardware at the point of sale and optimizes for seamless payment and receipt for the consumer and merchant.",

Pirate Chain harnesses Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) from Komodo, zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKs) transactions from ZCash, and the rule of enforced private-only transactions by Monero. \r\n\r\nWhereas many other “privacy” coins have optional privacy features, Pirate (ARRR) claims to be a 100% private send cryptocurrency, as well as the first 'z transaction-only' chain. ZK-Snarks technology (zero-knowledge cryptography) is utilized to shield peer to peer transactions. The team claims that this has created the largest shielded private pool of funds of any privacy coin. \r\n\r\nPirate is protected from 51% attacks by utilizing Komodo’s dPoW, meaning its blocks are notarized onto both Komodo and Bitcoin blockchains. Attempts to mount a Sybil attack against Pirate would have to overcome the combined hashrates of Bitcoin, Komodo, and Pirate. This is an astronomical cost that would deter malicious actors. Pirate started with a fair launch -  no ICO, premine, and 0 dev fees.",

            "description": "Telos (TLOS) describes itself as a smart contract blockchain running on EOSIO software. It makes use of Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus. TLOS is the native currency of Telos and is used for acquiring resources for decentralized applications (dApps), voting for block producers, worker proposals, election arbitrators and other on chain governance. The governance features used by Telos' core system are available for dApp developers to include in their projects.\r\n\r\nThe Telos blockchain reportedly offers dApp developers 0.5 second block times, transaction rates in excess of 1000 transactions per second, and free transactions. Developers can reportedly build blockchain applications that provide a similar user experience to conventional applications. \r\n\r\nThe blockchain went live in December 2018 using a modified EOS genesis snapshot (the result of the EOS token sale) where all accounts were capped at a maximum of 40000 TLOS. This resulted in a broad and relatively equitable initial distribution of approximately 300 million tokens EOS genesis account holders. 18 million tokens were granted to the founders of the chain and 6 million to the Telos Foundation. The current supply of TLOS is 355 million and token inflation is 0%.",

Through the Lightning Network, small high-frequency settlements in the advertising field may become a possibility.

With a mature advertising business model, DAD has attracted investments from the likes of OGC, NEO, and DHVC. As a supernode for several blockchain programs such as Ontology, NEO, and VSYS, DAD has also joined the governance committee led by Klaytn (the brainchild of Kakao) and has partnered with members (such as Kakao, LG Electronics, Celltrion, Union Bank of the Philippines) to promote the development of a global blockchain ecosystem.",

HEX is designed to be a store of value to replace the Certificate of Deposit as the blockchain counterpart of that financial product used in traditional financial markets. HEX is also designed to leverage off the emerging DeFi (Decentralised Finance) ecosystem in cryptocurrencies within the Ethereum network. \r\n\r\nHEX uses the Ethereum network for the transaction layer (sending and receiving HEX tokens, as well as interacting with the HEX smart contract), whilst the consensus code and staking mechanism is contained in the HEX smart contract.\r\n\r\nHEX allows a user to stake his or her HEX coins for a share of the new HEX coin issuance, or inflation and contains features designed to incentivize behaviors that encourage price appreciation and disincentivize behaviors that encourage harm to the price. The HEX smart contract penalizes stakers for ending their stake early and rewards them for staking larger amounts of HEX for longer periods.\r\n\r\nHEX is distributed to Bitcoin holders by way of a snapshot of the Bitcoin UTXO set that occurred on 2 December 2019 at block height 606227. The distribution of HEX to Bitcoin holders is 10,000 HEX per 1 BTC. Bitcoin holders are able to claim HEX only during the first year of launch. During this period, HEX is also obtained in exchange for ETH through interacting with the HEX smart contract.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first year of launch, all HEX coins that were not claimed by Bitcoin holders are distributed to the rest of the HEX users who have stakes that are active. The maximum possible annual inflation of HEX is designed to be 3.69% after the first year of launch.",
